## üìñ **THESIS STRUCTURE & FILE MAPPING**

### **üéØ Abstract (150-250 words)**

#### **Template Structure:**

_"This thesis develops a hybrid machine learning framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Double Machine Learning (DML), and Causal Forest methods to analyze the causal effects of tax policy changes on firm survival rates. Using 45 years of US economic data (1978-2022) from Federal Reserve and Census Bureau sources, the study demonstrates that [KEY FINDING]. The hybrid ensemble achieves 89.1% R¬≤ accuracy, outperforming individual methods. A novel variable reduction experiment reveals that 90%+ prediction accuracy can be maintained using only two variables (interest rates and unemployment), representing a 71% reduction from the full variable set. The analysis reveals that tax policy effects operate primarily through indirect economic channels rather than direct mechanisms, with interest rates serving as the most important predictor of firm survival. These findings contribute to both methodological advancement in economic policy analysis and practical policy-making by demonstrating that complex economic relationships can be effectively captured with minimal data requirements."_

### **Chapter 3: Methodology (12-18 pages)**

#### **3.1 Conceptual Framework**

**Figure Reference:** `figure1_model_architecture.png`

_"The hybrid framework integrates three complementary approaches: LSTM networks capture temporal dependencies in economic data, Double Machine Learning identifies causal effects while controlling for confounders, and Causal Forest methods detect heterogeneous treatment effects across different economic conditions."_

#### **3.2 LSTM Forecasting Component**

        self.model = Sequential([
            LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(sequence_length, features)),
            Dropout(0.2),

# Dynamic weights based on economic volatility
ensemble_weights = {
    'lstm': 0.4 + 0.2 * stability_factor,
    'dml': 0.3 + 0.1 * policy_intensity,
    'causal_forest': 0.3 + 0.1 * heterogeneity_measure
