    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a comprehensive economic policy analysis framework that combines:\n",
    "1. **LSTM Neural Networks** for macroeconomic forecasting\n",
    "2. **Double Machine Learning (DML)** for causal inference\n",
    "3. **Causal Forest** for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation\n",
    "4. **Hybrid/Ensemble Methodology** for robust policy recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Objective:**  \n",
    "Estimate the causal impact of tax/VAT policies on firm survival rates using real US economic data from FRED, BLS, and administrative records.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Sources:**\n",
    "- Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API\n",
    "- Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) API\n",
    "- Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) CSV files\n",
    "- CPI, GDP, Unemployment Rate CSV files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Innovation:**  \n",
    "Integration of time-series forecasting with causal inference to provide forward-looking policy impact assessments with uncertainty quantification.\n",

    "|----------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|\n",
    "| **Out-of-Sample R²** | Predictive accuracy on unseen data | R² > 0.80 | R² < 0.60 |\n",
    "| **Cross-Validation Consistency** | Performance stability across time | RMSE variation < 10% | RMSE varies > 20% |\n",

    "### **🚨 Warning Signs of Approximation (Not Accurate Prediction):**\n",
    "- **Always predicting near the mean** (lack of variability)\n",
    "- **Poor out-of-sample performance** (overfitting to training data)\n",
    "- **Residuals showing patterns** (systematic bias)\n",

    "1. **Check Recent Predictions**: Compare last month's predictions vs actual outcomes\n",
    "2. **Monitor Residuals**: Look for new patterns or increasing errors  \n",
    "3. **Update Cross-Validation**: Re-run validation with latest data\n",

    "### **📊 Advanced Validation (For Research):**\n",
    "- **Backtesting**: Test predictions on historical periods you didn't train on\n",
    "- **Robustness Checks**: Add noise to inputs and verify prediction stability\n",
    "- **Benchmark Comparison**: Compare against simple baseline models\n",
    "- **Economic Plausibility**: Ensure predictions align with economic theory\n",
    "- **Peer Review**: Have other economists validate your methodology\n",

    "### **💡 Pro Tips for Thesis Defense:**\n",
    "- **Always report out-of-sample performance** (never just in-sample)\n",
    "- **Show residual plots** to demonstrate no systematic bias\n",
    "- **Include confidence intervals** in all predictions\n",
    "- **Discuss model limitations** honestly\n",
    "- **Provide economic interpretation** of statistical results"
